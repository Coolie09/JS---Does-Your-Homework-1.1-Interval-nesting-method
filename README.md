# JS-Math - BETA

# Warning! ⚠️
This code may contain (unlikely) a few bugs! Please contact me in therefor in the issues section! Thx a lot!
(It is important, to have installed the chrome extension "tamperkey"!)

# What does this script do? 
This project is a collection of many scripts solving math problems and equations, for exemple the theorem of pythagoras. <br>
Many of them arn't avaiable, but'll come as soon as possible!

# How to use this 
There is no proper implementation using an event listener yet. For this reason, the appropriate section of code must be taken and inserted into the console, making <br> changes to the input as necessary. In the near future, when the script will be further extended, there will be a button to start the project, where a prompt can be used <br> to perform the desired operation.
